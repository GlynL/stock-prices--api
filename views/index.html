        I can GET /api/stock-prices with form data containing a Nasdaq stock
        ticker and recieve back an object stockData.
      </li>
      <li>
        In stockData, I can see the stock(string, the ticker), price(decimal in
        string format), and likes(int).
      </li>
      <li>
        I can also pass along field like as true(boolean) to have my like added
        to the stock(s). Only 1 like per ip should be accepted.
      </li>
      <li>
        If I pass along 2 stocks, the return object will be an array with both
        stock's info but instead of likes, it will display rel_likes(the
        difference betwwen the likes) on both.
      </li>
      <li>
        A good way to recieve current price is the following external
        API(replacing 'GOOG' with your stock):
        https://finance.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ%3aGOOG
      </li>
      <li>All 5 functional tests are complete and passing.</li>
